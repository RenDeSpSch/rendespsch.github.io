Enhance Code Quality and Security
Much better code than my Sprint One or Sprint Two.

No PEP8 warnings.

There are some warnings because Pycharm does not
understand that the variables are defined when the user
gives input.

Increased robustness for y/n questions. Drastically 
lowered the amount of typing the user needs to perform.
